      <p>Static site generators are soooo hot right now.</p>
<p>But let's face it. They're a pain in the ass. It's a fact. Anyone who's ever switched to a static site generator for the purposes of blogging has fallen off the face of the earth. It's been documented <a href="http://wswld.net/2013/08/06/why-static-site-generators-arent-good-for-my-blog/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.kevindangoor.com/2012/03/wordpress-to-octopress-and-back/">here</a>, and <a href="http://mikerooney.rowk.com/2013/02/11/migrating-from-octopress-to-wordpress-really/">here</a>. </p>
<p>Why? because <strong>Fact Of The Day</strong>: SSG's are a pain in the ass.  </p>
<p>And why is that?<br />
When people switch to SSG's, they tend to screw around with their site instead of focusing on writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"for several months I’ve been experimenting with static generators, I’ve hardly written half a post. It was a common problem, as I googled it. People dug so deep into the endless customization and switching that eventually they’ve stopped writing." - Vsevolod Glumov</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me however, the point of my site is to have something to screw around with, and I write like once a month anyway. </p>
<p>What does bother me though, is <strong>the fact that I have to start a web-server to write a blog post</strong>. On the outset this might not seem like a big deal, "It's just one terminal command" you say. Yes, but given the fact that my dev environment is in an Ubuntu VM, it means I have to start the VM, ssh into the VM, cd into the folder, then start the web-server, open up SublimeText and start writing, then open a browser, go to the page I'm writing, and heaven forbid LiveReload isn't working for some reason, then it's save refresh save refresh every time I make a change. Even if LiveReload is working, it's still save reload, save reload, save reload,... so yeah, having to start a web-server to write a blog-post is kind of a big deal. </p>
<p>I also hear you saying, <em>"but Jan, you don't have to start a server to write a blog post, it's just a markdown file"</em>. But I think visually, and being able to see what my post looks like as I write is critical for me. </p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org/features/">Ghost</a> seems to agree with this idea. They've made this dual-pane markdown/preview WYSIWYG writing experience a core part of their product. </p>
<figure><img src="../../content/4-blog/20-nvalt-middleman-ftw/1.png" alt="1" /></figure> 
<p>(markdown on the left, post preview on the right)</p>
<p>Ghost however, is just a blogging platform, and being that my blog is not the main focus of my site, Ghost is not the solution for me. </p>
<h2>Drumroll... enter nvALT</h2>
<figure class="left"><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/"><img src="../../content/4-blog/20-nvalt-middleman-ftw/4.png" alt="4" /></a></figure> With [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/), I've discovered an amazing way to write *that works with my SSG* (I'm using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), btw). [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and even [Ghost](https://ghost.org), uses markdown for blog posts. 
There are many markdown editors for the mac, and most let you customize the CSS. But I wanted more. I wanted the full WYSIWYG experience, like Ghost. 
This is where nvALT really delivers. nvALT let's you customize the entire HTML/CSS/JS  preview of your markdown files, *so you see what your posts look like, as your writing them*. You don't even have to press save, nvALT saves as you type.  
And for the icing on the cake, *the preview window is responsive*.

nvALT preview window: desktop size. 
*( ... I just put a picture of my blog post in my blog post... that just got kinda meta )*
The default template files, [template.html](https://github.com/ttscoff/nv/blob/master/template.html) and [custom.css](https://github.com/ttscoff/nv/blob/master/custom.css), have recently been excluded from nvALT, but it's enough to copy them from the github repo, stick them in <code>~/Library/Application Support/nvALT/</code> and you're off to the races. 
The Current Workflow
---
as it stands:
1. Create the post in nvALT using markdown.
2. Export the file to the Middleman blog directory, ending it it 'html.md' for markdown.
4. Use the [Middleman Github Pages  gem](https://github.com/neo/middleman-gh-pages) to one-step-commit-and-publish the site to github pages. 
I don't even have to start the web-server because I'm using the same CSS and HTML in the preview as I am on my live site, so I'm 100% sure posts will look the same in production as they do in the preview. Heck, I can even symlink the production CSS file from my site directory to the nvALT template directory so that nvALT always has the most current CSS file as my site.
