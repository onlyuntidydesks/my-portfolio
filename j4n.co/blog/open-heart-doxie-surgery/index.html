    <div class="row post">
      <p>This isn't about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=doxie&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=udMxU6-WKMLQ7AbHvIHABw&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&biw=1210&bih=560">dogs</a>, it's about the <a href="http://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go/">Doxie Go Scanner</a>, and how I MacGyvered it back into shape with nothing but a piece of paper and some masking tape.</p>
<p>After what felt like months of waiting, my Doxie Go scanner finally arrived at the post office today. This itself was a miracle, considering the package had been stopped at customs, requiring me to send them a copy of the receipt along with a signed translation and a photocopy of my ID. </p>
<p>On top of that, once it did arrive at the post office, I had to pay an extra $46 to pick it up, because customs felt it necessary to added a 23% VAT tax to the package (probably something to do with the fact that I bought it from the Doxie U.S. store and shipped it to Poland). </p>
<p>So after all that, my shiny Doxie scanner finally arrives at it's destination. I plug it in and let it charge -- feeling relieved that it includes a euro-plug adapter. </p>
<p>Then I began scanning. So far so good. I pull a receipt out of my wallet. Most of my receipts are crumpled from being in my wallet all day. I try to straighten this one out, but it's still pretty crumply. I think to myself, what the heck, I'll feed into the Doxie anyway. I mean, what's the worst that can happen...</p>
<p>The receipt goes in. It doesn't come out.</p>

<p>A feeling of dread comes over me. The receipt got stuck in the Doxies roller! </p>
<p>There's no way this is coming out. I try tweezers, a bent paperclip. Nothing works.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2VFF9X8N4sQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>At this point I'm totally lost. I see no solution in sight, and I begin to think that the receipt will be stuck there forever. The scanner itself is still perfectly functional, but I'm at a point of dispair. </p>
<p>Then I take a break, go out on the balcony to get some fresh air, and the idea hits me.</p>
<p>Tape! if I stick double sided tape to the bottom of a piece of paper, and feed it into the Doxie, then the receipt should stick to the tape, and come out with the piece of paper.</p>
<p>I don't have double sided tape, so I just use some masking tape.</p>
<p>I feed the paper in, and...</p>
<figure><img src="../../content/4-blog/14-open-heart-doxie-surgery/doxie_2.jpg" alt="doxie_2" /></figure>
<p>I rejig the paper a couple of times. Eventually I manage to pull out the paper along with the receipt.</p>

<h2>Victory!</h2>
<figure><img src="../../content/4-blog/14-open-heart-doxie-surgery/doxie_4.jpg" alt="doxie_4" /></figure>
<p>After some gentle tugging, I manage to get the receipt out along with the taped piece of paper. I breathe a sigh of relief. It worked.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>If you want to scan a crumply receipt: <strong>USE THE PHOTO SLEEVE!</strong> So that this doesn't happen to you!</p>
<p>Also, the Doxie support staff gets an A+ for their support. I sent a ticket about this issue and within 10 minutes I got a response:</p>
